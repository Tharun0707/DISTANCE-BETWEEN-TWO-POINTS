# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module.
### Step 2: 
Get values for the two points (x and y).
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Print the value using print function.
### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
import math
x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(d,2))

  


### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points was successfull executed.
